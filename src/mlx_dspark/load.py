# Model registry — invisible plumbing that auto-resolves the *drafter* for a known *target*.
#
# The interface is standard (like mlx-lm): you pass a real target repo/path as `--model`. This
# table just saves you from also looking up the matched drafter for the handful of known targets;
# for anything else, pass `--drafter`. Matching is quant-agnostic (the drafter matches the *model*,
# not its quantization), so Qwen3-8B-4bit / -8bit / -bf16 all resolve the same drafter. There are
# **no user-facing nicknames** — `id` is only the substring we match against a target repo name.
# `speedup` is the measured headline ratio from the README table (M4 Pro, mlx 0.32, warm,
# vs greedy baseline) — a human string for pickers, not a promise; content and machine move it.
# `lookup_drafts: False` marks pairs whose measured-best configuration runs with hybrid
# n-gram lookup drafts OFF — the shipped default then reproduces the vouched-for numbers with
# no flag (see lookup_drafts_default; an explicit --lookup-drafts/--no-lookup-drafts wins).

    # Paired vs RadixArk (M4 Pro, warm, 3-trial medians, 200 tok, small-M kernel on, lookup off):
    # **`--max-draft 7` = 1.99x mean** (chat 1.51x / code 2.14x / math 2.31x, accept

    # acceptance at every cap/content. The confidence head does NOT pay here (already-high
    # acceptance -> conf-truncation just sheds accepted tokens), so no --confidence-threshold;
    # and block-15 buys nothing past cap 7 (cap 8 = 1.18x — verify width 9 exits the small-M
    # kernel window M in [6,8]). static_cap picks **7** unaided here (its block-15 backbone cost

    # single-row greedy). Loaded with zero model-code change.
    #
    # **8-bit -> RadixArk/Qwen3.8-27B-DSpark** (kept — DimInfer is 4-bit-class, not measured at
    # 8-bit). The first **SpecForge/SGLang**-packaged head here: DFlash-backbone DSpark, block_7
    # anchor-as-pos0, YaRN rope (factor 32 / orig 8192, honored), reuses embed AND lm_head,

    # catch: 8-bit decode reads ~2x the weight bytes, so ABSOLUTE throughput is ~parity with 4-bit

    stay resident under memory pressure instead of getting paged mid-generation.

    **OPT-IN since 0.6.1 — this is no longer called by default, and it can hang the machine.**
    Wired pages cannot be reclaimed by the OS, so raising the ceiling to the recommended
    working set (36 GiB of 48 on an M4 Pro) while the process already holds ~23 GiB left
    macOS nothing to page out: the system locked up hard enough to need a power cycle, during
    a run that loaded Qwen3-14B and Qwen3-8B back to back. Note the shape of that risk — a
    16 GB Mac's recommended working set is ~12 GiB, so "the model nearly fills RAM", the very
    case this was added for, is also the case most likely to wedge.

    Short of hanging, it corrupts memory during long generations on the **gemma-4/mlx-vlm**
    route: a ~430-token run produced a verify-logits buffer full of garbage, so ``argmax``
    returned sequential position indices instead of token ids and the accepted-prefix length
    came back as 350 for a 4-token draft. It surfaced as ``IndexError`` only by luck —
    different garbage would have committed plausible *wrong* tokens and silently broken
    losslessness, which is the one guarantee this project makes. 3/3 crashes with it, 3/3
    clean 1000-token runs without. mlx-lm-route targets did **not** reproduce it (Qwen3-14B
    1260 tokens, Qwen3-8B 1501 tokens, both clean at a *higher* 22.8 GiB peak), so it is not
    a simple memory-pressure threshold.

    It also bought nothing measurable where it was tested: same machine, same prompts,
    baseline 18.2 vs 18.3 tok/s and dspark 47.1 vs 46.7 tok/s with vs without (<1%, well
    inside the ~14% run-to-run noise), because a 20 GiB working set on a 48 GB machine has
    no paging pressure to prevent. It earns its keep only when the model nearly fills RAM —
    a 12 GB model on a 16 GB Mac — which is the case it was added for. Turn it on there with
