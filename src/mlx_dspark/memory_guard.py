"""Memory-pressure guard: shed what we can before macOS swaps the model out from under us.

The fits-but-swaps cliff: a big model plus its KV cache, prefix-cache snapshots (a hybrid
checkpoint copies whole recurrent states — ~150 MB fp32 per rung on Qwen3.8-27B, up to 8 per
slot, 2 slots) and the MLX allocator's *retained* free buffers can creep past what macOS will
keep resident. The OS compresses, then swaps, and decode collapses ~10x (issue #14's 45-on-48 GB
shape). Nothing in the engine noticed — until :mod:`roofline` started
reading ``kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level``. This module acts on it.

Design (edge-triggered, threaded through the generation thread, never racing it):

- A daemon thread polls the pressure level every few seconds (a microsecond sysctl). A
  transition *into* WARN, or *up to* CRITICAL, requests a shed. Steady pressure does not
  re-trigger; a second shed at the same level needs ``rearm_s`` to pass (120 s) — after the
  first one there is little left to give, and clearing the allocator cache every tick would
  kill freed-buffer reuse for nothing.
- The shed itself runs **on the MLX generation thread**: immediately (via the engine's
  single-worker executor) when the engine is idle, or — when a generation is in flight — at the
  next **round boundary** through the engine's per-round hook. WARN waits up to ``defer_s``
  (60 s) for the request to finish first (a mid-run ``mx.clear_cache()`` forfeits buffer reuse
  for the rest of that generation); CRITICAL takes the very next round. A round is the finest
  granularity there is — a Metal forward can't be interrupted from Python.
- **What WARN frees:** ``mx.clear_cache()`` — the allocator's *retained* buffers, often GBs
  after a long prefill, which macOS counts as ours and which cost nothing to re-acquire — plus
  the prefix cache's interior rungs (~150 MB fp32 each on a 27B hybrid). Every conversation
  KEEPS its boundary checkpoint: the A/B (NOTES "Memory-pressure guard") measured dropping one
  as a 36 s re-prefill under pressure to free 0.6 GB, while the cache clear freed 1.3 GB for
  free. **CRITICAL** empties the prefix cache outright (a critical Mac is about to thrash or
  kill; the re-prefill is the lesser cost). Weights are never touched; the model keeps serving.
- Every shed is recorded (level, bytes freed, when) for ``/health.warnings``, ``/machine`` and
  the log, so a user can see *why* a turn re-prefilled.

Pure enough to test model-free: the poller, clock, and the two actions are injectable.
