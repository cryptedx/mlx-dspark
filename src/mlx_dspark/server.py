"""OpenAI-compatible HTTP server for mlx-dspark — serve a DSpark / DFlash / baseline
model over `/v1/chat/completions` so any OpenAI client (LM Studio, the `openai` SDK,
`curl`, LangChain, …) can talk to it locally.

Design choices (deliberate):
  * **Stdlib only.** Built on ``http.server`` (like mlx-lm's own server) so installing
    mlx-dspark stays lean — no FastAPI/uvicorn/pydantic pulled in.
  * **One model, loaded once.** The target + drafter are heavy (~8–15 GB) and load at
    startup; the ``model`` field in a request is echoed back but the loaded pair is always
    used. ``GET /v1/models`` advertises what's loaded.
  * **Serialized generation.** MLX is a single device context and every request builds its
    own KV cache, so generations can't safely interleave — an ``Engine`` lock runs them one
    at a time (correct for a single-user local server; extra requests queue).
  * **Lossless, and it shows.** Whatever the mode, output equals normal decoding of the
    target; the speculative speedup surfaces in a non-standard ``x_mlx_dspark`` block
    (accept length, tok/s) and at ``GET /metrics``.

Endpoints: ``POST /v1/chat/completions`` (stream + non-stream), ``POST /v1/completions``,
``POST /v1/messages`` (Anthropic — see ``anthropic_api.py``), ``POST /v1/responses`` (OpenAI
Responses API — see ``responses_api.py``), ``GET /v1/models``, ``GET /health``,
``GET /metrics``.
