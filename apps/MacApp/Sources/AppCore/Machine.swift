//
// Every "GPU %" gauge on a Mac lies about decode (a bandwidth-starved GPU reads busy). The
// engine instead compares what it measures against physics: a single-stream decode can never
// beat `bandwidth ÷ bytes-per-token`, and speculative decoding is the thing that legitimately
// does. `/machine` carries both halves — the chip's measured bandwidth and the loaded model's
// exact byte footprint — plus what macOS itself says about memory pressure.

/// A banner-worthy condition the engine reports on `/health.warnings` — live memory pressure,
/// or a load-time note (the context-window RAM estimate) that used to reach only its stderr.
